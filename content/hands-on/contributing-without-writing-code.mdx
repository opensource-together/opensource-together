Not all open source contributions involve writing code.

Many of the most impactful contributions improve clarity, usability, and community health.

This guide focuses on meaningful ways to contribute without touching the codebase.

---

## Code Is Only One Part of a Project

Open source projects rely on:

- documentation
- communication
- organization

- moderation

Without these, even great code struggles to survive.

---

## Documentation Contributions

Improving documentation is one of the highest-impact contributions.

This includes:

- fixing typos
- clarifying confusing sections
- adding missing explanations

- restructuring content for clarity

Documentation improvements help every future user.

## Improving Examples and Tutorials

Examples often reveal usability issues.

You can contribute by:

- adding realistic examples
- simplifying existing ones
- updating outdated tutorials
- explaining edge cases

Examples bridge the gap between theory and practice.

---

## Reporting and Refining Issues

Well-written issues are valuable contributions.

You can help by:

- improving issue descriptions
- adding reproduction steps
- clarifying expected behavior
- linking related issues

This saves maintainer time and improves decision-making.

---

## Issue Triage

Issue triage helps maintain project hygiene.

This includes:

- labeling issues
- closing duplicates
- identifying outdated reports
- asking for missing information

Triage keeps projects manageable.

## Helping Other Users

Many projects have discussion spaces.

You can contribute by:

- answering questions

- linking relevant documentation

Helping others strengthens community trust.

Accessibility improvements benefit everyone.

This can include:

- clearer language

Accessibility is a continuous process.

---

## Translations and Localization

Some projects welcome translations.

You can contribute by:

- translating documentation
- reviewing translations
- maintaining language consistency

Localization expands reach.

## Design and UX Contributions

Some projects welcome design input.

This may include:

Moderation enables participation.

Processes shape contributor experience.

You can suggest:

Process improvements scale impact.

---

## Communicating Contributions Clearly

Non-code contributions should be communicated clearly.

When contributing:

- explain the problem
- describe the improvement
- highlight benefits

Clarity helps maintainers evaluate quickly.

---

## Valuing Non-Code Work

Non-code contributions:

- reduce friction
- increase adoption
- improve sustainability

They are as legitimate as code contributions.

---

## What You Should Be Able to Do Now

You should now be able to:

- identify non-code contribution opportunities
- contribute meaningfully without coding
- recognize the impact of non-code work
- engage with projects in diverse ways

Contribution takes many forms.

## Reflection

Ask yourself:

- Which non-code areas interest me?
- Where do I notice friction or confusion?
- How could I help improve the experience for others?

Awareness leads to contribution.
