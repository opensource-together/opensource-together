Finding the right first project matters more than making the perfect first contribution.

A good project sets you up for learning, confidence, and long-term engagement.

This guide helps you choose **where to start**.

---

## The Goal of This Guide

By the end of this guide, you will:

- know where to look for open source projects
- understand how to evaluate a project quickly
- avoid common beginner traps
- choose **one concrete project** to engage with

This guide focuses on **selection**, not contribution yet.

---

## Start From What You Already Use

The best first projects are often already in your workflow.

Think about:

- libraries you use regularly
- tools you rely on
- frameworks you enjoy
- CLIs you run often

Familiarity reduces cognitive load and speeds up understanding.

---

## Where to Find Open Source Projects

Projects can be discovered through multiple entry points.

Common places include:

- repositories of tools you already use
- GitHub search and explore
- package registries
- recommendations from peers
- community-curated lists

Avoid starting from random trending repositories.

---

## Using GitHub to Discover Projects

When browsing on GitHub, pay attention to:

- repository description
- recent activity
- open issues
- documentation quality

A project does not need to be popular to be healthy.

---

## Signs of a Healthy Project

Healthy projects usually show:

- recent commits
- issues with thoughtful discussion
- maintainers responding respectfully
- clear documentation
- a defined scope

These signals matter more than star count.

---

## Signals That a Project Is Beginner-Friendly

Look for:

- `good first issue` or `help wanted` labels
- contribution guidelines
- clear issue descriptions
- welcoming tone in discussions

Beginner-friendly does not mean low-quality.

---

## Projects to Be Careful With

Some projects are difficult first choices.

Be cautious with projects that:

- have no documentation
- show hostile communication
- have hundreds of unresolved issues
- lack maintainer responses
- are overly complex infrastructure

Difficulty without guidance slows learning.

---

## Small Projects vs Large Projects

Small projects:

- offer faster feedback
- expose more of the codebase
- allow broader impact

Large projects:

- have stronger processes
- require more context
- can feel intimidating

Both are valid, but small projects often provide a better first experience.

---

## Reading a Repository With Intent

When you open a repository, focus on:

- the README
- the folder structure
- recent commits
- open issues

You are not trying to understand everything — only enough to decide if it feels approachable.

---

## Checking Activity and Maintenance

Look at:

- last commit date
- issue response times
- pull request activity

An inactive project is not necessarily bad, but it may limit learning opportunities.

---

## Understanding Project Scope

Good first projects have:

- a clear purpose
- limited scope
- defined boundaries

Avoid projects that try to solve too many problems at once.

---

## Aligning With Your Motivation

Choose a project that matches your goal:

- learning a new ecosystem
- improving existing skills
- contributing to something you care about
- understanding real-world workflows

Alignment increases persistence.

---

## Avoiding the “Perfect Project” Trap

You do not need the perfect project.

You need:

- a real project
- real people
- real constraints

Action beats endless searching.

---

## Making a Shortlist

Create a shortlist of 2–3 projects.

For each project, ask:

- Do I understand what it does?
- Does it feel active?
- Does the tone feel respectful?
- Can I imagine contributing something small?

Choose the one that feels least intimidating.

---

## Commit to One Project

Commitment matters.

Pick one project and:

- bookmark it
- read its documentation
- follow its activity

You can always change later.

---

## Reflection

Answer these questions:

- Why did I choose this project?
- What do I hope to learn from it?
- What feels unclear or intimidating?

Noticing uncertainty is part of the process.
