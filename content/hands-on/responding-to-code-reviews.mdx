Code reviews are a core part of open source collaboration.

They exist to improve quality, share knowledge, and align changes with project direction.

This guide focuses on responding to reviews constructively and confidently.

---

## What Code Reviews Are For

Code reviews help to:

- catch bugs and edge cases
- improve readability and consistency
- share context and knowledge
- protect long-term maintainability

Reviews are about the change, not the person.

---

## Reading Review Feedback Carefully

When you receive feedback:

- read all comments first
- avoid reacting immediately
- identify questions vs suggestions vs required changes

Understanding intent matters more than speed.

---

## Separating Signal From Emotion

It is normal to feel defensive at first.

Try to:

- focus on the technical substance
- ignore tone assumptions
- ask for clarification when unsure

Most feedback is meant to help the project, not criticize you.

---

## Types of Review Comments

Common types include:

- clarification requests
- suggested improvements
- required changes
- alternative approaches
- questions about intent

Each type requires a different response.

---

## Responding to Clarification Requests

If something is unclear:

- explain your reasoning
- add comments or documentation if needed
- update the code to make intent clearer

Clarity benefits future contributors as well.

---

## Handling Suggested Changes

Suggested changes are optional unless stated otherwise.

You can:

- apply them
- discuss trade-offs
- explain why you chose a different approach

Discussion is part of collaboration.

---

## Handling Required Changes

Required changes should be addressed directly.

Good practices include:

- acknowledging the feedback
- making the requested updates
- confirming once done

This builds trust with reviewers.

---

## Asking Questions

If feedback is unclear:

- ask for examples
- request clarification
- confirm understanding before changing code

Asking questions is a sign of engagement, not weakness.

---

## Updating Your Pull Request

When making updates:

- keep changes focused
- avoid introducing unrelated modifications
- push new commits or amend as requested

Communicate what changed after updates.

---

## Keeping the Discussion Public

Keep discussions in the pull request when possible.

Public discussion:

- preserves context
- helps others learn
- avoids duplicated questions

Private messages should be avoided unless necessary.

---

## Handling Disagreements Respectfully

Disagreements happen.

When they do:

- focus on project goals
- reference documentation or prior decisions
- avoid personal framing
- accept maintainer decisions

Maintainers are responsible for project direction.

---

## Knowing When to Stop

Sometimes:

- discussions loop
- priorities differ
- maintainers decide against the change

Knowing when to stop is part of collaboration.

---

## After the Review Is Complete

Once feedback is resolved:

- thank the reviewers
- stay available until merge
- follow up if needed

Courtesy reinforces positive collaboration.

---

## Learning From Reviews

Each review teaches:

- project conventions
- maintainer expectations
- design preferences
- communication patterns

Reviews accelerate growth.

---

## What You Should Be Able to Do Now

You should now be able to:

- read review feedback calmly
- respond constructively
- update your pull request effectively
- handle disagreement respectfully

These skills apply across all open source projects.

---

## Reflection

Ask yourself:

- Which feedback was most useful?
- What patterns do you notice?
- What would you do differently next time?

Reflection turns feedback into progress.
