title: "Chapter 9: When a Pull Request Is Not Accepted"
description: "When a pull request is not accepted, it is important to understand the reasons why and how to improve for future contributions."
---

Not every pull request gets merged.

This is a normal and expected part of open source collaboration.

This guide focuses on understanding rejection and responding constructively.

---

## Rejection Is Not Failure

A pull request being closed or rejected does not mean:

- your work was useless
- your skills are insufficient
- your contribution was unwelcome

It usually reflects project constraints, priorities, or direction.

---

## Common Reasons Pull Requests Are Not Accepted

Pull requests may be declined due to:

- scope mismatch
- project roadmap decisions
- maintenance burden
- alternative solutions preferred
- timing issues
- architectural concerns

These factors are often independent of code quality.

---

## Reading the Response Carefully

When a pull request is not accepted:

- read the explanation fully
- identify the main concern
- separate feedback from outcome

Understanding the reason is more important than the result.

---

## Responding Respectfully

A respectful response includes:

- acknowledging the decision
- thanking maintainers for their time
- avoiding defensive language

Professionalism leaves a positive impression.

---

## Asking for Clarification

If the reason is unclear:

- ask politely for clarification
- avoid challenging the decision
- focus on learning

Clarification can provide valuable insight.

---

## Learning From Rejection

Rejections often teach:

- project priorities
- hidden constraints
- design philosophy
- contribution boundaries

This knowledge improves future contributions.

---

## Deciding What to Do Next

After a rejection, you can:

- adjust the proposal
- contribute in another area
- apply lessons to another project
- take a break if needed

Walking away is sometimes the healthiest option.

---

## Avoiding Emotional Burnout

Rejection can be discouraging.

To protect yourself:

- avoid over-identifying with outcomes
- take breaks when needed
- remember that open source is collaborative, not competitive

Sustainability matters.

---

## Maintaining Long-Term Perspective

Open source collaboration is cumulative.

One rejected pull request does not define your trajectory.

Consistency and learning compound over time.

---

## Leaving the Door Open

Even after rejection:

- maintain a positive tone
- stay engaged if appropriate
- follow project updates

Future opportunities may arise.

---

## What You Should Be Able to Do Now

You should now be able to:

- interpret pull request rejection calmly
- respond professionally
- extract learning from the experience
- continue contributing with confidence

Resilience is a key open source skill.

---

## Reflection

Ask yourself:

- What did I learn from this outcome?
- How can I apply this insight?
- What kind of contribution would feel better next?

Growth often follows discomfort.
