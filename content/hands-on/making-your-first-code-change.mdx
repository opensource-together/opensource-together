Your first code change should be small, focused, and easy to review.

The goal is not to impress, but to integrate smoothly into an existing codebase.

This guide focuses on making a change that is respectful of the project and its maintainers.

---

## Choosing the Right Change

Good first changes are:

- small in scope
- easy to understand
- low risk
- clearly connected to an issue

Avoid large refactors or architectural changes at this stage.

---

## Confirming Before You Start

Before writing code:

- confirm the issue is accepted
- check if someone is already working on it
- clarify expectations if needed

Alignment saves time and effort.

---

## Creating a New Branch

Always create a new branch for your change.

Branches:

- isolate your work
- keep the main branch clean
- make review easier

Name branches clearly and descriptively.

---

## Understanding Project Conventions

Before changing code, observe:

- code style
- file organization
- naming patterns
- testing practices

Consistency matters more than personal preference.

---

## Making a Focused Change

Limit your change to:

- one issue
- one concern
- one goal

Small changes are easier to review and more likely to be accepted.

---

## Writing or Updating Tests

If the project uses tests:

- update existing tests
- add new tests when appropriate
- ensure tests reflect expected behavior

Tests communicate intent.

---

## Running Tests and Checks

Before committing:

- run tests
- run linters or formatters
- fix obvious issues

This shows respect for maintainer time.

---

## Committing With Intent

Good commits:

- have clear messages
- describe the “why”
- are logically grouped

Avoid large, unfocused commits.

---

## Keeping Changes Readable

Readable code:

- uses clear naming
- avoids unnecessary complexity
- follows existing patterns

Readability is more important than cleverness.

---

## Avoiding Scope Creep

Stick to the agreed scope.

If you notice other issues:

- document them separately
- open a new issue later

Bundling unrelated changes creates friction.

---

## Preparing for Review

Before opening a pull request:

- review your own changes
- read diffs carefully
- remove debug code
- ensure clarity

Self-review improves quality.

---

## What You Should Have Now

You should now have:

- a clean branch
- a focused code change
- passing tests
- confidence in your change

You are ready to propose your work.

---

## Reflection

Ask yourself:

- Is this change easy to understand?
- Does it align with the issue?
- Would I approve this if I were a maintainer?

Empathy improves collaboration.
