Issues are where most open source work begins.

They are used to report problems, propose ideas, and discuss changes.

This guide helps you read issues with context and confidence.

---

## What Issues Are Used For

Issues are used to:

- report bugs
- request features
- propose improvements
- discuss ideas
- track work

They are shared problem spaces, not task lists.

---

## Not All Issues Are the Same

Issues can represent very different things.

Common types include:

- bug reports
- feature requests
- questions
- design discussions
- maintenance tasks

Understanding the type of issue helps you respond appropriately.

---

## Reading an Issue With Intent

When opening an issue, focus on:

- the problem being described
- the context provided
- the expected outcome
- any constraints mentioned

Do not jump to solutions immediately.

---

## Understanding the Problem Statement

A good issue explains:

- what is happening
- what was expected
- why it matters

If this is unclear, the issue may need clarification before action.

---

## Looking for Context and History

Many issues reference:

- previous issues
- pull requests
- discussions
- documentation

Follow these links to understand the full picture.

---

## Reading Comments Carefully

Comments often contain:

- clarifications
- alternative approaches
- maintainer decisions
- scope adjustments

The most important information is not always in the first message.

---

## Identifying Maintainer Signals

Maintainer comments often signal:

- whether the issue is accepted
- priority level
- preferred direction
- potential blockers

These signals guide whether and how to engage.

---

## Understanding Labels

Labels help categorize issues.

Common labels include:

- bug
- enhancement
- documentation
- discussion
- good first issue
- help wanted

Labels provide quick orientation but are not always complete.

---

## Good First Issues

Good first issues usually:

- have clear descriptions
- are limited in scope
- include guidance or context
- are low-risk changes

They are designed to reduce onboarding friction.

---

## Issues to Be Careful With

Be cautious with issues that:

- are very broad
- lack clear goals
- involve major refactors
- have heated discussions
- show unresolved disagreement

These require more context and experience.

---

## When to Comment on an Issue

It is appropriate to comment when:

- asking for clarification
- confirming interest
- sharing relevant information
- proposing a small, scoped approach

Avoid commenting just to say “I’ll work on this” without context.

---

## Understanding Ownership and Assignment

Some projects assign issues formally.

Others rely on informal signals.

Before starting work:

- check if someone is already working on it
- ask if the issue is available
- respect existing claims

Coordination prevents duplicated effort.

---

## Issues as Learning Tools

Even without contributing, reading issues teaches:

- how decisions are made
- what problems matter
- how trade-offs are discussed

Issues are a window into project thinking.

---

## Accepting Uncertainty

It is normal to feel unsure when reading issues.

At this stage:

- you are building familiarity
- you are not expected to have answers
- observation is valuable

Understanding grows with exposure.

---

## What You Should Be Able to Do Now

You should now be able to:

- identify different types of issues
- understand the problem being discussed
- recognize maintainer signals
- decide whether an issue feels approachable

That is enough to move forward.

---

## Reflection

Ask yourself:

- Which issues feel clear?
- Which feel confusing?
- What information is missing?

These observations help you grow as a contributor.
