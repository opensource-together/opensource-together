title: "Chapter 5: Forking a Repository and Setting Up Locally"
description: "Before you can contribute code, you need a local copy of the project."
---

Before you can contribute code, you need a local copy of the project.

This guide explains how forking works and how to prepare a project to run on your machine.

---

## Understanding Forks

A fork is your personal copy of a repository.

Forks allow you to:

- experiment safely
- make changes without affecting the original project
- propose changes through pull requests

Forking is a standard open source workflow.

---

## Forking vs Cloning

Forking:

- creates a copy under your account
- is required to propose changes to most projects

Cloning:

- creates a local copy on your machine
- does not create a new repository on the platform

Most contributions involve both.

---

## Creating a Fork

To create a fork:

- use the platform’s fork action
- create the fork under your account
- keep the default settings

Once forked, the repository belongs to you.

---

## Cloning Your Fork Locally

After forking, clone the repository:

- use the repository URL
- choose a location on your machine
- verify the clone completes successfully

You now have a local working copy.

---

## Understanding Remotes

Remotes define where your local repository connects.

Common remotes include:

- `origin` → your fork
- `upstream` → the original repository

Understanding remotes is important for staying in sync.

---

## Adding the Upstream Remote

Adding the upstream remote allows you to:

- fetch changes from the original project
- keep your fork up to date

This prevents divergence over time.

---

## Keeping Your Fork Updated

To stay aligned with the original project:

- fetch changes from upstream
- merge or rebase as needed
- update your local branches

Regular updates reduce merge conflicts.

---

## Reading Setup Instructions

Before running anything:

- read the README setup section
- check documentation
- note required versions
- identify environment variables

Skipping setup instructions causes unnecessary friction.

---

## Installing Dependencies

Most projects require dependencies.

Common steps include:

- installing packages
- building assets
- running setup scripts

Follow instructions exactly before troubleshooting.

---

## Running the Project Locally

Once dependencies are installed:

- start the project
- run tests if applicable
- confirm expected behavior

Successful local setup is a milestone.

---

## Troubleshooting Setup Issues

If setup fails:

- re-read the documentation
- search existing issues
- check error messages carefully
- ask for help if needed

Setup issues are common and expected.

---

## Avoiding Early Changes

At this stage:

- do not modify code yet
- focus on understanding setup
- verify everything works

Confidence comes from stability.

---

## What You Should Have Now

You should now have:

- a forked repository
- a local clone
- a working development environment
- a basic understanding of project setup

This is your foundation for contributing.

---

## Reflection

Ask yourself:

- Which parts of setup were unclear?
- What assumptions did the project make?
- What would help future contributors?

These insights often lead to good first contributions.
