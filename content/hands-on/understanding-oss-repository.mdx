Opening an open source repository for the first time can feel overwhelming.

This guide helps you read a repository **with intent**, without trying to understand everything at once.

The goal is not mastery — it is **orientation**.

---

## What This Guide Is About

This guide helps you:

- understand what a repository contains
- identify the important files
- locate where changes usually happen
- build a mental map of the project

You are learning how to **navigate**, not how to contribute yet.

---

## Start With the README

The README is the primary entry point.

Read it to answer:

- What does this project do?
- Why does it exist?
- Who is it for?
- How is it used?
- How do people contribute?

If the README does not answer these questions, note the gaps.

---

## Skim, Don’t Dive

You are not expected to read everything.

At this stage:

- skim headings
- ignore implementation details
- look for structure and intent

Depth comes later.

---

## Understanding the File Tree

The file tree gives you a high-level view of the project.

Look for:

- `src/` or equivalent (where the main code lives)
- `docs/` (long-form documentation)
- `tests/` or similar (testing strategy)
- configuration files
- root-level documentation files

You are mapping, not memorizing.

---

## Identifying the Entry Point

Most projects have a clear entry point.

This could be:

- a main file
- a CLI command
- an application bootstrap
- an exported API

Knowing where execution starts helps orient everything else.

---

## Reading Documentation Beyond the README

Check for:

- additional documentation folders
- links in the README
- comments pointing to deeper explanations

Documentation often answers questions before issues do.

---

## Understanding Project Scope Through Files

The presence or absence of certain files tells a story.

For example:

- many configs → complex setup
- many tests → quality emphasis
- many examples → user-focused design

Structure reflects priorities.

---

## Exploring Issues to Understand Context

Issues reveal how the project evolves.

Look at:

- open issues
- recently closed issues
- how maintainers respond
- how discussions unfold

This helps you understand what the project values.

---

## Looking at Recent Commits

Recent commits show:

- activity level
- areas under development
- commit style
- pace of change

You do not need to read the diffs yet.

---

## Finding Contribution Guidelines

Look for:

- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- instructions in the README
- `.github/` templates

These files explain:

- how changes are proposed
- expectations for contributors
- review processes

Reading them early prevents mistakes later.

---

## Understanding Tooling and Setup

Identify:

- required runtime versions
- package managers
- build tools
- test commands

You are not setting anything up yet — just noting requirements.

---

## Accepting Partial Understanding

It is normal to feel lost.

At this stage:

- you do not understand everything
- you are not supposed to
- confusion is expected

Understanding grows through repetition and exposure.

---

## What You Should Know Before Moving On

Before continuing, you should be able to answer:

- What does this project do?
- Where does the main code live?
- How do people usually interact with it?
- Where are discussions happening?

That is enough.

---

## Reflection

Ask yourself:

- What parts of the repository feel clear?
- What parts feel confusing?
- What would you need explained better?

These questions guide future contributions.
