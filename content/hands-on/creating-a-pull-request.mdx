A pull request is a proposal to change a project.

It combines code, explanation, and communication in a single place.

This guide focuses on creating pull requests that are easy to review and easy to trust.

---

## What a Pull Request Represents

A pull request represents:

- a problem being addressed
- a solution being proposed
- a discussion space
- a request for review

It is not just a code submission.

---

## Opening a Pull Request at the Right Time

Open a pull request when:

- the change is complete
- tests pass
- the scope is clear
- the intent is well defined

Draft pull requests can be used for early feedback if the project supports them.

---

## Choosing the Right Base Branch

Make sure your pull request targets:

- the correct branch
- the branch specified in contribution guidelines

Targeting the wrong branch creates unnecessary work.

---

## Writing a Clear Pull Request Title

A good title:

- is concise
- describes the change
- avoids vague language

Examples:

- “Fix crash when config file is missing”
- “Improve error message for invalid input”

Titles set the tone for review.

---

## Explaining the Context

Start the description by explaining:

- what problem is being solved
- why it matters
- how it affects users or maintainers

Assume the reviewer has not read the full issue history.

---

## Describing the Solution

Clearly describe:

- what was changed
- how the solution works
- any trade-offs or limitations

Avoid unnecessary detail, but do not omit important context.

---

## Linking Related Issues

If the pull request relates to an issue:

- link it explicitly
- reference it in the description

This connects discussion and decision-making.

---

## Following Pull Request Templates

If a template exists:

- follow it
- fill all relevant sections
- remove unused placeholders

Templates exist to help reviewers.

---

## Keeping Pull Requests Focused

A good pull request:

- addresses one concern
- avoids unrelated changes
- keeps diffs readable

Large pull requests are harder to review and slower to merge.

---

## Preparing for Review

Before submitting:

- review your own changes
- check formatting
- re-read the diff
- ensure clarity

Self-review improves review quality.

---

## Understanding Automated Checks

Many projects use automated checks.

These may include:

- tests
- linters
- formatting rules

Failing checks usually block review.

Fix them before asking for feedback.

---

## Being Available After Submission

After opening a pull request:

- monitor notifications
- respond to questions
- clarify when needed

Silence can slow progress.

---

## What You Should Be Able to Do Now

You should now be able to:

- open a clear pull request
- explain your changes effectively
- align with project expectations
- invite constructive review

This is a major step in contributing.

---

## Reflection

Ask yourself:

- Is the problem clear without extra explanation?
- Would this be easy to review?
- Does the change align with project direction?

Clarity reduces friction.
