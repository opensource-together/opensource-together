Opening an issue is often the first visible interaction you have with a project.

A good issue helps maintainers understand a problem quickly and decide what to do next.

This guide focuses on writing issues that are **useful, respectful, and actionable**.

---

## What an Issue Is (and Is Not)

An issue is:

- a problem report
- a proposal
- a discussion starter

An issue is not:

- a demand
- a support ticket
- a guarantee of implementation

Issues invite collaboration.

---

## When to Open an Issue

Open an issue when:

- you found a bug
- documentation is unclear or incorrect
- a feature is missing
- behavior is surprising
- something feels inconsistent

If you are unsure, searching existing issues first is always the right move.

---

## When Not to Open an Issue

Avoid opening an issue when:

- the documentation already answers the question
- the issue is purely personal preference
- the project explicitly discourages certain requests
- the topic is already actively discussed elsewhere

Respecting scope builds trust.

---

## Checking Before You Write

Before creating an issue:

- search existing issues
- read the README
- check contribution guidelines
- review documentation

This prevents duplicates and shows consideration.

---

## Understanding Issue Templates

Many projects provide issue templates.

Templates exist to:

- standardize information
- reduce back-and-forth
- help maintainers act faster

Follow them closely.

---

## Writing a Clear Title

A good title:

- is specific
- describes the problem
- avoids vague language

Examples:

- “CLI crashes when config file is missing”
- “Documentation example fails on latest version”

Titles set expectations.

---

## Describing the Problem

A clear issue description includes:

- what happened
- what you expected to happen
- why it matters

Avoid assumptions about intent or quality.

Focus on observable behavior.

---

## Providing Reproduction Steps

If reporting a bug, include:

- environment details
- steps to reproduce
- minimal examples
- error messages or logs

Reproducibility determines actionability.

---

## Including Context

Context helps maintainers decide faster.

Include:

- links to relevant documentation
- related issues or PRs
- screenshots or code snippets when helpful

Context reduces guesswork.

---

## Proposing, Not Demanding

If suggesting a feature:

- describe the problem first
- explain the use case
- suggest an approach cautiously

Avoid prescriptive language.

Maintain flexibility.

---

## Tone and Communication

Effective issues are:

- respectful
- neutral
- concise
- collaborative

Avoid:

- frustration-driven language
- blame
- sarcasm

Tone influences response quality.

---

## After Opening the Issue

Once the issue is open:

- be ready to answer questions
- provide clarification if asked
- accept that priorities may differ

Silence does not imply rejection.

---

## Understanding Maintainer Responses

Maintainers may:

- ask for more information
- redirect the issue
- close it with explanation
- accept it for future work

All outcomes are valid.

---

## Issues as Contributions

Opening a good issue is a real contribution.

It:

- improves project quality
- saves maintainer time
- helps other users
- shapes future work

Not all contributions involve code.

---

## What You Should Be Able to Do Now

You should now be able to:

- decide when to open an issue
- write a clear and helpful issue
- communicate respectfully
- handle responses constructively

This is a major step in open source collaboration.

---

## Reflection

Ask yourself:

- What problem am I trying to surface?
- Is my issue clear without extra explanation?
- Would I understand this issue if I were a maintainer?

Clarity is empathy.
