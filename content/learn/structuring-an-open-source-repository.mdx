Repository structure shapes how people understand, use, and contribute to a project.

A clear structure reduces cognitive load and makes collaboration easier.

This chapter focuses on organizing a repository so that it communicates intent, clarity, and stability.

---

## The Repository as an Interface

A repository is not just a container for code.

It is an interface between the project and the outside world.

Visitors use it to:

- understand what the project does
- decide whether to trust it
- determine how to engage

Structure influences these decisions immediately.

---

## First Impressions Matter

Most visitors will:

- skim the file tree
- open the README
- check recent activity

A repository should be understandable within minutes.

If structure is confusing, most users will leave silently.

---

## Root-Level Clarity

The root of the repository should answer fundamental questions.

Common root-level elements include:

- `README.md`
- `LICENSE`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- `SECURITY.md`
- configuration files

Avoid clutter at the root.

---

## A Common Repository Layout

While layouts vary by ecosystem, a simple and common structure looks like:

```
project-name/
├── src/
├── tests/
├── docs/
├── .github/
│   ├── ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
│   ├── PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
└── SECURITY.md

```

This layout communicates intent and expectations clearly.

---

## Source Code Organization

Source code should:

- follow ecosystem conventions
- have predictable entry points
- use consistent naming
- group related concerns

Avoid over-engineering early.

Clarity is more important than abstraction.

---

## Tests as Documentation

Tests serve two purposes:

- verifying behavior
- documenting expected usage

Readable tests:

- explain how the system works
- reduce ambiguity
- increase confidence for contributors

A project without tests can still be open source, but tests greatly improve trust.

---

## Documentation Structure

Documentation should be discoverable and layered.

Common approaches:

- inline comments for local clarity
- README for high-level context
- `/docs` for deeper explanations
- examples or tutorials for onboarding

Avoid scattering documentation across unrelated files.

---

## The `.github` Directory

The `.github` directory defines how collaboration happens.

Common contents include:

- issue templates
- pull request templates
- workflows
- contribution guidelines

These files shape contributor behavior more than rules alone.

---

## Issue Templates

Issue templates help:

- collect useful information
- reduce back-and-forth
- guide contributors toward clarity

Well-designed templates save maintainer time.

---

## Pull Request Templates

Pull request templates:

- set expectations
- encourage good explanations
- standardize review

They help contributors understand what maintainers need.

---

## Naming Conventions and Consistency

Consistency matters more than perfection.

Choose:

- a naming style
- a folder structure
- formatting rules

Apply them consistently.

Inconsistent projects are harder to contribute to than imperfect ones.

---

## Configuration and Tooling

Configuration files should:

- be documented
- have clear defaults
- avoid unnecessary complexity

Tooling should:

- support contributors
- not overwhelm newcomers

Every tool introduces cognitive overhead.

---

## Version Control Hygiene

Good version control practices include:

- meaningful commit messages
- focused commits
- clear branch naming

Public history is part of the project’s communication.

---

## Signals of Stability

Repository structure sends signals.

Stable projects often:

- change structure infrequently
- document changes clearly
- deprecate intentionally

Frequent structural changes create confusion.

---

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls

Common structural mistakes include:

- deeply nested folders
- unclear entry points
- duplicated concepts
- outdated documentation
- unused files left behind

Removing confusion is as valuable as adding features.

---

## Reflection

Look at a repository you admire:

- how is it structured?
- what feels intuitive?
- what feels confusing?

Structure communicates values and priorities.
