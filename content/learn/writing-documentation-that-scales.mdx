title: "Chapter 7: Writing Documentation That Scales"
description: "Documentation is the interface between the project and the outside world. It shapes how people understand, use, and contribute to a project."
---

Documentation is the primary way people understand, use, and contribute to an open source project.

It determines whether a project feels welcoming or opaque.

This chapter focuses on writing documentation that scales with users, contributors, and time.

---

## Documentation as Infrastructure

Documentation is not an afterthought.

It is infrastructure that supports collaboration.

Good documentation:

- reduces repeated questions
- lowers onboarding friction
- aligns expectations
- preserves knowledge over time

Poor documentation silently repels contributors.

---

## Documentation Is an Interface

For most people, documentation is the first interaction with a project.

It should:

- explain what the project is
- clarify who it is for
- describe how it works
- guide people toward next steps

Documentation shapes trust before code is read.

---

## Layers of Documentation

Effective documentation is layered.

A common structure includes:

- overview and context
- quick start
- conceptual explanations
- step-by-step guides
- references
- examples

Each layer serves a different purpose.

---

## The Role of the README

The README is the entry point.

It should clearly answer:

- what the project does
- why it exists
- who it is for
- how to use it
- how to contribute

A README that tries to do everything often does nothing well.

---

## Quick Start Matters

A quick start:

- reduces time to first success
- builds confidence
- encourages exploration

It should:

- be minimal
- be reproducible
- work on a fresh environment

First success creates momentum.

---

## Conceptual Documentation

Conceptual documentation explains:

- mental models
- architecture
- core ideas
- trade-offs

This type of documentation:

- helps contributors reason about changes
- prevents incorrect assumptions
- scales understanding beyond code comments

Concepts age slower than tutorials.

---

## Guides and Tutorials

Guides walk users through specific tasks.

Good guides:

- focus on one goal
- avoid unnecessary branching
- explain why steps matter
- assume no prior context

Guides should be skimmable and actionable.

---

## Reference Documentation

Reference documentation:

- lists APIs
- defines options
- documents configurations

It should be:

- complete
- precise
- boring

Reference docs are for lookup, not learning.

---

## Examples and Use Cases

Examples bridge the gap between theory and practice.

They:

- show real usage
- clarify edge cases
- reduce guesswork

Examples should be:

- realistic
- minimal
- maintained

Outdated examples erode trust.

---

## Writing for Unknown Readers

Documentation should assume:

- no prior knowledge
- no shared context
- no internal jargon

Avoid:

- vague references
- unexplained acronyms
- internal assumptions

Write for someone discovering the project for the first time.

---

## Tone and Voice

Tone matters.

Effective documentation is:

- respectful
- clear
- neutral
- confident without being arrogant

Avoid:

- defensive language
- sarcasm
- gatekeeping phrasing

Documentation sets the emotional tone of the project.

---

## Keeping Documentation Up to Date

Documentation decays over time.

To reduce decay:

- update docs alongside code changes
- treat documentation changes as first-class contributions
- review docs during releases

Outdated documentation is worse than no documentation.

---

## Documentation and Contributors

Clear documentation:

- empowers contributors
- reduces maintainer workload
- improves contribution quality

Documentation is one of the most impactful contributions someone can make.

---

## Common Documentation Pitfalls

Common issues include:

- overly long introductions
- missing prerequisites
- skipped steps
- undocumented assumptions
- fragmented content

Clarity requires intentional editing.

---

## Reflection

Review documentation from a project you use:

- what helped you most?
- what confused you?
- what was missing?

These observations inform better documentation practices.
