Licensing is what makes a project legally open source.

Without a license, a public repository is **not** open source, even if the code is visible.

This chapter explains how licensing works, why it matters, and how to choose a license that aligns with your goals.

---

## Why Licensing Exists

A license defines:

- how others can use your code
- what they are allowed to modify
- how they can redistribute it
- what obligations they have

By default, **copyright law applies**.

This means that without a license, no one is allowed to legally use, copy, or modify your code.

A license is not a restriction — it is a permission.

---

## Licenses as Trust Infrastructure

Licenses create trust between:

- authors
- contributors
- users
- organizations

They reduce ambiguity and legal risk, making collaboration possible at scale.

Clear licensing encourages adoption.

---

## Open Source Licenses vs Source-Available

Not all public code is open source.

Open source licenses:

- grant usage, modification, and redistribution rights
- comply with Open Source Initiative (OSI) definitions

Source-available licenses:

- allow code viewing
- restrict usage, modification, or redistribution

Being explicit avoids confusion.

---

## The Role of the Open Source Initiative

The Open Source Initiative (OSI):

- defines what qualifies as open source
- maintains an approved license list
- promotes open source standards

Using an OSI-approved license ensures compatibility and clarity.

---

## Common License Families

Open source licenses generally fall into two broad categories.

---

## Permissive Licenses

Permissive licenses allow broad usage with minimal restrictions.

They generally:

- allow commercial use
- allow modification
- allow redistribution
- require attribution

### MIT License

- Simple and permissive
- Minimal requirements
- Widely used

Commonly chosen for:

- personal projects
- startups
- libraries
- tooling

---

### Apache License 2.0

- Similar to MIT
- Includes explicit patent protection
- More detailed terms

Often used by:

- companies
- large-scale projects
- enterprise tooling

---

## Copyleft Licenses

Copyleft licenses require derived works to remain open source.

They:

- enforce openness downstream
- prevent proprietary forks
- prioritize community continuity

---

### GPL (General Public License)

- Strong copyleft
- Derivatives must use the same license
- Commercial use is allowed, but openness is enforced

Common in:

- community-driven projects
- ideological open source
- long-lived infrastructure

---

## Weak Copyleft Licenses

Some licenses apply copyleft more selectively.

Examples include:

- LGPL
- MPL

These allow linking or partial use without enforcing full openness.

---

## Choosing a License Intentionally

License choice should be intentional, not accidental.

Consider:

- Do you want maximum adoption?
- Do you want derivatives to stay open?
- Do you care about patent protection?
- Will companies use this project?

Different goals lead to different licenses.

---

## A Practical Decision Framework

If your goal is:

- simplicity and adoption → permissive license
- protecting openness → copyleft license
- corporate compatibility → Apache-style license

There is no universally “best” license.

---

## License Compatibility

Not all licenses are compatible with each other.

When combining dependencies:

- check their licenses
- ensure compatibility
- avoid conflicting terms

Ignoring compatibility can create legal issues.

---

## Where to Declare a License

Licensing should be explicit and visible.

Best practices:

- add a `LICENSE` file at the root
- mention the license in the README
- ensure consistency across documentation

Clarity matters more than verbosity.

---

## Changing a License Later

Changing a license is possible, but complex.

It often requires:

- agreement from all contributors
- clear ownership history
- careful communication

Choosing wisely early avoids future friction.

---

## Licensing and Contributors

Contributors implicitly agree to your license when they contribute.

Some projects:

- require Contributor License Agreements (CLAs)
- use Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

These add clarity but also friction.

They should be introduced deliberately.

---

## Legal Confidence Without Legal Complexity

You do not need to be a lawyer to open source a project.

You do need to:

- choose a standard license
- apply it consistently
- be transparent about expectations

Standard licenses exist to simplify this process.

---

## Reflection

Think about:

- how you want others to use your work
- how much control you want to retain
- how you feel about commercial usage

Licensing reflects values as much as legal terms.
