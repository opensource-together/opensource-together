Making a project open source is not just a technical action.

It is a **decision** that impacts your code, your communication, and your long-term responsibilities.

This chapter focuses on **preparation**:

what to check, what to clean, and what to clarify *before* making a project public.

---

## Open Source Is a Point of No Return

Once a project is public:

- people can inspect it
- fork it
- discuss it
- form opinions about it

Preparation is not about perfection.

It is about **intentional exposure**.

---

## Clarifying Intent Before Going Public

Before touching the repository, clarify the intent of the project.

Ask yourself:

- Why am I open-sourcing this?
- What do I expect from others?
- Am I open to external influence?
- How much time can I realistically invest?

Unclear intent leads to unclear decisions later.

---

## Ownership and Rights

Before publishing anything, ensure you have the right to do so.

Confirm that:

- you own the code
- you are allowed to publish all dependencies
- no employer or client has claims on the project
- no proprietary assets are included

Open source without ownership clarity creates legal risk.

---

## Security and Sensitive Information

Public repositories must never contain secrets.

Audit your project for:

- API keys
- tokens
- passwords
- private URLs
- internal identifiers
- credentials in commit history

This includes:

- configuration files
- environment variables
- documentation examples

Once public, secrets should be considered compromised.

---

## Code Readiness

Your code does not need to be perfect.

It needs to be **understandable**.

Focus on:

- clear naming
- consistent structure
- minimal dead code
- obvious entry points
- predictable behavior

If something is experimental or incomplete, say so explicitly.

---

## Build and Setup Reliability

A public project should be reproducible.

Check that:

- the project builds without internal dependencies
- setup instructions actually work
- versions are specified
- errors are understandable

If users cannot run the project, they cannot contribute.

---

## Documentation as a Gatekeeper

Documentation is the first line of interaction.

At minimum, your project should explain:

- what it does
- why it exists
- how to run it
- who it is for
- what is out of scope

Documentation sets expectations before code is ever read.

---

## Defining Scope Explicitly

Many open source projects fail due to unclear scope.

Clarify:

- what the project aims to solve
- what it intentionally does not solve
- what kind of contributions are welcome
- what kind are not

Explicit boundaries reduce conflict.

---

## Repository Hygiene

A clean repository builds trust.

Check for:

- unused files
- experimental branches
- unclear folders
- outdated scripts
- inconsistent formatting

Clarity matters more than cleverness.

---

## Commit History and Signals

Public commit history is part of the project’s narrative.

It communicates:

- how the project evolved
- how decisions were made
- how disciplined the workflow is

You do not need a perfect history, but you should be comfortable standing behind it.

---

## Preparing for Questions and Feedback

Once public, your project will invite:

- questions
- suggestions
- criticism
- feature requests

Preparation includes mental readiness:

- not all feedback will align with your vision
- not all contributions should be accepted
- silence is sometimes better than rushed responses

You are allowed to say no.

---

## Maintenance Expectations

Open source does not mean:

- instant responses
- unlimited support
- roadmap commitments

Before publishing, decide:

- how often you want to engage
- how you will handle inactivity
- how you will communicate limitations

Clear expectations protect both you and contributors.

---

## A Pre-Release Checklist

Before making a project public, verify that:

- ownership is clear
- secrets are removed
- setup works
- scope is documented
- expectations are explicit
- you are comfortable with public visibility

Preparation is a form of respect for future contributors.

---

## Reflection

Consider a project you might open-source:

- what parts are unclear?
- what assumptions are implicit?
- what would confuse a stranger?

These questions guide meaningful preparation.
