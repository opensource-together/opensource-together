Open source shapes careers in subtle but powerful ways.

It creates public evidence of skills, collaboration, and long-term thinking.

This chapter explores how open source engagement intersects with professional growth.

---

## Open Source as Public Work

Unlike private work, open source is visible.

It shows:

- how you write code
- how you communicate
- how you handle feedback
- how you collaborate over time

Visibility creates opportunity.

## Skills Demonstrated Through Open Source

Open source demonstrates more than technical ability.

It reveals:

- problem-solving
- system design

- leadership

These signals matter in professional contexts.

## Contribution History as a Narrative

Your open source history tells a story.

It shows:

- what problems interest you
- how you approach learning

Consistency matters more than volume.

Sustainability supports long-term growth.

Leadership is often informal but visible.

Not all projects serve the same purpose.

---

## Reflection

Consider your goals:

Open source is a tool, not an obligation.

It is a long-term practice of learning, collaboration, and shared ownership.

Engaging thoughtfully creates value for:

- projects
- communities
- careers
