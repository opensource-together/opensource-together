This chapter lays the foundation for everything that follows.

Before talking about tools, licenses, or repositories, it’s essential to understand **what open source really is**, **why it exists**, and **how to approach it with the right expectations**.

---

## What Open Source Is (and Is Not)

Open source means that the **source code of a project is publicly available** and can be used, modified, and shared under specific conditions defined by a license.

But open source is **not**:

- just “code on GitHub”
- a free support channel
- a guarantee of quality
- a shortcut to success

Open source is a **collaborative process** built around shared ownership and public work.

> Open source is less about code visibility and more about collaboration design.
>

## Why Open Source Exists

Open source emerged from a simple idea:

> Knowledge grows when it is shared.
> 

Over time, it became a powerful way to:

- avoid duplicated work
- improve software quality through peer review
- build tools collectively
- enable global collaboration
- create shared infrastructure for the internet

Today, most modern software relies on open source at some level.

## Why People and Organizations Use Open Source

Projects are open-sourced for many reasons:

- To learn in public
- To get feedback early
- To attract contributors
- To build trust and transparency
- To increase adoption
- To create ecosystems around tools
- To improve hiring and visibility
- To reduce long-term maintenance costs through shared effort

Different motivations lead to **different project structures** — something we’ll explore later.

---

## A Mental Model for Open Source

Instead of thinking of open source as a “repository”, think of it as:

- a **public workshop**
- a **shared responsibility**
- a **living system**
- a **long-term commitment**

Publishing code is the beginning, not the end.

## The Human Side of Open Source

Every open source project involves people:

- users
- contributors
- maintainers
- reviewers
- community members

This means:

- communication matters
- tone matters
- expectations matter
- documentation matters

> Most open source problems are social problems, not technical ones.
>

## Common Misconceptions

### “My code isn’t ready”

Most open source projects start imperfect.

Clarity and honesty matter more than polish.

### “Open source is only for experts”

Many valuable contributions don’t involve writing code at all.

### “People will steal my idea”

Ideas are abundant. Sustaining a project is the real challenge.

### “Once it’s open source, it runs itself”

Open source requires ongoing attention and care.

## Your Role in Open Source

There is no single way to participate.

You might:

- use open source tools
- report issues
- improve documentation
- submit small fixes
- maintain a project
- design contributor experiences

Roles evolve naturally over time.

---

## Setting the Right Expectations

Before going further, it’s important to understand that:

- open source is not instant validation
- growth is often slow at first
- contributors don’t appear automatically
- maintenance is real work

Approaching open source with realistic expectations leads to healthier projects and communities.

---

## Reflection

Take a moment to consider:

- What attracts you to open source?
- Are you more interested in contributing, creating, or both?
- What kind of projects excite you?

You don’t need a final answer yet — this guide will help you refine it.

## What Comes Next

In the next chapter, we’ll zoom out and look at **open source as a system**:

- how projects are structured
- how collaboration actually happens
- why some projects thrive and others stagnate
