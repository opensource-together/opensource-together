title: "Chapter 10: Community, Governance, and Trust"
description: "Community, governance, and trust are the foundation of open source collaboration. They shape how people interact with a project and how decisions are made."
---

Open source communities grow around shared work, but they are sustained by trust.

Governance and community norms shape how decisions are made and how people interact over time.

This chapter focuses on building stable, respectful, and resilient open source communities.

## Community Is More Than Contributors

A community includes:

- users
- contributors
- maintainers
- reviewers
- observers

Not everyone participates in the same way, but all interactions influence community health.

---

## Trust as a Foundation

Trust allows people to:

- contribute without fear
- share ideas openly
- accept feedback
- invest time and effort

Trust is built through consistency, transparency, and fairness.

---

## Why Governance Matters

Governance defines:

- who makes decisions
- how decisions are made
- how disagreements are resolved
- how leadership evolves

Without governance, power becomes implicit and unpredictable.

---

## Explicit vs Implicit Governance

All projects have governance, whether documented or not.

Implicit governance:

- relies on personal authority
- scales poorly
- creates uncertainty

Explicit governance:

- documents decision-making
- clarifies roles
- increases fairness
- supports growth

Clarity reduces conflict.

---

## Common Governance Models

Projects use different governance structures.

Examples include:

- single maintainer
- core team
- benevolent dictator
- merit-based maintainers
- foundation-led governance

No model is universally best.

---

## Decision-Making Processes

Decisions can be made through:

- maintainer consensus
- proposals and reviews
- votes
- delegated authority

What matters is that the process is understood.

---

## Documenting Decisions

Documenting decisions:

- preserves context
- avoids repeated debates
- builds institutional memory

Public decisions reinforce transparency.

---

## Codes of Conduct

Codes of conduct define acceptable behavior.

They:

- protect community members
- set behavioral expectations
- provide enforcement mechanisms

A code of conduct signals that safety matters.

---

## Enforcement and Accountability

Rules without enforcement erode trust.

Effective enforcement requires:

- clear reporting paths
- consistent responses
- confidentiality
- fairness

Enforcement should focus on protecting the community, not punishing individuals.

---

## Moderation and Boundaries

Moderation is a form of care.

It includes:

- removing harmful content
- de-escalating conflict
- setting limits
- protecting vulnerable participants

Healthy moderation enables participation.

---

## Inclusion and Accessibility

Inclusive communities:

- welcome diverse perspectives
- reduce unnecessary barriers
- respect different communication styles

Accessibility improves collaboration for everyone.

---

## Handling Growth and Change

As communities grow:

- norms evolve
- expectations shift
- new tensions emerge

Governance should adapt intentionally, not reactively.

---

## Transparency and Communication

Open communication builds trust.

This includes:

- sharing priorities
- explaining decisions
- acknowledging limitations
- being honest about challenges

Silence often creates more harm than imperfect communication.

---

## Avoiding Common Community Failures

Common failure patterns include:

- unchecked maintainer power
- unclear rules
- favoritism
- inconsistent enforcement
- ignored contributors

Awareness helps prevent these outcomes.

---

## Reflection

Think about a community you trust:

- what makes it feel safe?
- how are decisions made?
- how is conflict handled?

These elements inform healthy governance.
