# TypeScript Error Fix Summary

## Issue
The CI/CD pipeline was failing with a TypeScript error in `UserProjectController`:

```
src/contexts/project/infrastructure/controllers/user-project.controller.ts:76:46 - error TS2345: Argument of type 'Project[]' is not assignable to parameter of type '{ author: { ownerId: string; name: string; avatarUrl: string; }; repositoryInfo: RepositoryInfo; lastCommit: LastCommit; commits: number; contributors: Contributor[]; project: Project; }[]'.
```

## Root Cause
The `getUserProjects` method in `UserProjectController` was using the wrong response DTO. It was using `GetProjectsResponseDto` which expects enriched project data with GitHub information, but the `FindProjectsByUserIdQuery` returns simple `Project[]` objects.

## Solution
Changed the response DTO from `GetProjectsResponseDto` to `GetProjectsByUserIdResponseDto` which is specifically designed to handle `Project[]` arrays.

### Changes Made:
1. Updated import statement:
   ```typescript
   // Before
   import { GetProjectsResponseDto } from './dto/get-projects-response.dto';
   
   // After
   import { GetProjectsByUserIdResponseDto } from './dto/get-projects-by-user-id-response.dto';
   ```

2. Updated the return statement:
   ```typescript
   // Before
   return GetProjectsResponseDto.toResponse(projects.value);
   
   // After
   return GetProjectsByUserIdResponseDto.toResponse(projects.value);
   ```

## Next Steps
1. The branch needs to be updated with the latest changes from main
2. Run `pnpm install` and `pnpm run build` to verify the fix
3. The TODO comment in the code indicates that GitHub stats enrichment should be added in the future to match the functionality of the main `getProjects` endpoint
